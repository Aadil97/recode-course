## Step 1: Setting up a new project

Every good code project starts with a git repository. To get started with your Virtual Pet project, you need to get your repository set up, and uploaded to GitHub.

## Learning Objectives
- Create a simple NPM project
- Explain why a complete README is important
- Initialize and push a git project

##  To complete this challenge, you will need to:
- Create a `virtual-pet` directory from the command line
- Initialize an NPM project in that repository
- Initialize a git repository within that directory
- Install Jest and save it as a dev dependency
- Set Jest as the test command for your project
- Create a `.gitignore` file and add `node_modules` to it
- Create a README.md file from the command line
- Write a clear README
- Add the README.md to the staging area
- Commit your changes with a clear message
- Push the project to GitHub
