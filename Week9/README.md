 ## Week 9

:one: Create your very own [Virtual Pet!](./VirtualPet) :cat:
There are also helpful *walkthroughs* for this challenge for when you get stuck! It's likely that this should take you a day or two to get through the whole excercise. You will be writing tests *and* writing Javascript. Please refer back to the Slides and recorded lecture on testing if you need a recap :star:


:two: *Personal Development* -- This week you will having 1-2-1's with Natalie who will be trying to get to understand what opportunities we need to be be on the look out for! :rocket:


:three: Get practising testing and coding in Javascript with the [TDD KATA] challenge (./TDDkata)
