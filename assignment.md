# Assignment - CodeWars
2
​
3
We've been working all week on mini-kata exercises to try and re-inforce your coding knowledge and to get you to problem solve. Fortunately, there is a website where you can attempt these exercises online for further practice!

​
5
CodeWars Kata start easy at a difficulty of 8 KYU. As you get better, you can go down levels to 1 KYU (that does take a lot of time and commitment though).

​

## Task
8
​
9
1. Sign up for an account on [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com). You will have to do a quick kata to get to the signup form! **IMPORTANT:** Make sure you specify `Manchester Codes` for clan on the signup (if you do forget, then add it later in Account Settings).

​

2. Work through the exercises below. If you do finish then browse CodeWars for more exercises and get your points up. Some of these will be hard - you may need to use Google / StackOverflow / Mozilla Developer Network to piece together solutions. Make sure you've gone through the resources on session 1's walkthrough as well.

## Bonus Points
28
​
29
* Create a repository called `codewars-kata`, and add, commit and push all of your solutions up to it (use the same folder/file structure as the `diy-kata` repository, splitting your solutions out into separate files).
30
* Look at the tests for each kata on CodeWars and see if you can translate them to Jest.
