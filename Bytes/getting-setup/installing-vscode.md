# Installing Visual Studio Code

## What is Visual Studio Code (often referred to as VS Code)?

"Visual Studio Code is a source code editor developed by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. It includes support for debugging, embedded Git control, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, and code refactoring." - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio_Code)

VS Code is rapidly becoming the go-to code editor for developers because of its ease of use and powerful features.
