# Bespoke Kata

In this week's track, you'll be writing code to pass tests that we've written.

## Learning objectives

To be able to answer "yes" to the following questions:

- Are you confident working with different data types and structures in JavaScript?
- Can you write functions to encapsulate a piece of logic?
- Can you write a test that describes the expected behaviour of a function?

In addition, you'll also get more practice using the skills you gained during the pre-course.

## Concepts

- Primitive data types - booleans, numbers, strings
- Data structures - arrays, objects
- Functions
- Operators
- Control-flow

## Challenge

This week's challenge uses the [JavaScript Basics](https://github.com/MCRcodes/javascript-basics) repository on GitHub. You will be pairing so please choose driver/navigator roles between you now (it doesn't matter who goes first, as you will swap over). 

**Driver:**

* [ ] Fork the [repository](https://github.com/MCRcodes/javascript-basics) to your own GitHub profile.
* [ ] Clone down your fork.
* [ ] Change directory into your cloned folder and run `npm install`.

**Navigator:**

You won't fork the existing repository, as you want to build on top of the work the current driver has done when you swap roles. The way around this is to clone down your partner's repository and push it up to an empty repository on your GitHub.

* [ ] Create a new repository on GitHub without a README called `javascript-basics`.
* [ ] Clone down your partner's repository (always use the SSH URL) and change directory into it.
* [ ] Rename the `origin` remote of the local repository to your partner's username (`git remote rename origin <your partner's username>`)
* [ ] Create a new remote named `origin` and set it to the SSH URL of your newly created remote repository (`git remote add origin <your repository url>`).

**Driver:**

* [ ] Add a remote to your local repository pointing towards your partner's (`git remote add <your_partners_username> <your_partners_ssh_repository_url>`).
* [ ] Run `npm install`.

You can find out more about how this all works in our [:zap: Git Pong](../bytes/git/git-pong.md) byte.

**Both Pairs:**

* [ ] Read the bytes below.
* [ ] Start on the walkthrough - step 1 is linked below.

## Bytes

Bytes are like our course encyclopedia if you wish. They cover concepts in more detail than in lectures - **you should read them as they pop up in walkthroughs**.
